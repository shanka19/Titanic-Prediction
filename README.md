# Titanic-Prediction
A project to demonstrate the usage of different Machine Learning Algorithms on the titanic dataset. 
The titanic dataset consists of features related to a passenger and the response is if a passenger survived the titanic disaster or not. 
A model to predicted survival based on the features is built and is also deployed on a AWS EC2 Instance. Currently, the model is deployed 
locally using a Flask API. To use it for prediction, you would need to clone this repository open a terminal and run thr app.py script.
It will then open the application on your local system. You may copy the URL into a web browser and the application will then function accordingly.
