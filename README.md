# Titanic-Prediction
A project to demonstrate the usage of different Machine Learning Algorithms on the titanic dataset. The titanic dataset consists of features related to a passenger and the response is if a passenger survived the titanic disaster or not. A model to predicted survival based on the features is built and is also deployed on a AWS EC2 Instance
